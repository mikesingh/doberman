iPhone 6s UI
==============
A responsive ui for the iPhone 6s. Clicking buttons switches iPhone image,
and clicking full screen opens up current selection for closer inspection.

Installation
* clone the repo
* `npm install`
* run `gulp`. You can also just run `gulp build`
* run `http-server .` from the root directory in a separate tab
* navigate to `localhost:8080` in the browser

Additional notes/ future improvements
* separate index.less into more manageable files, rather than one large files
* use es6 to clarify ui code
